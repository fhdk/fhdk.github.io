## Convert Standard menu

To be able to better serve a smaller device in landscape mode - I began looking at a collapsible icon menu to fit into the Blazor WASM ecosystem.

I found an article on [Microsoft Tech Community] covering this and a comment pointing to the commenters [Github repo].

With some minor modifications to suit my ideas - it became doable and I keeping this around for support my memory.
